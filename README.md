#ðŸ“° Fake News Detection System

The Fake News Detection project is a machine learning-based system developed to automatically classify news as real or fake. It is designed to analyze either a news headline or a complete news article to determine its authenticity with enhanced accuracy. The project aims to combat misinformation by leveraging various supervised learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack Used:

Programming Language: Python

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries & Tools:

Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data manipulation and analysis

Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning models and evaluation metrics

NLTK / spaCy â€“ Text preprocessing and NLP 

Matplotlib Seaborn â€“ Data visualization

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models Used:

To ensure robust and accurate classification, multiple models were trained and evaluated, including:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Linear Regression

3. Random Forest Classifier

4. Decision Tree Classifier

Each model was assessed based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with the best-performing model(s) selected for final implementation.

ðŸ§  How It Works:

Input: The user provides a news headline or full article text.

Preprocessing: The input is cleaned and tokenized (stopwords removed, lemmatization, etc.).

Feature Extraction: Text data is transformed using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.

Prediction: The processed text is fed into the trained machine learning model to classify the news as real or fake.

Output: The system returns a clear label indicating the authenticity of the news.
